thread_pool_size = 1               # Matches vCPU allocation
thread_pool_max_threads = 100      # Reduced from 500

### Buffer Pool (4GB total, 50% of 8GB RAM)
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G
innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size = 128M

### I/O Optimization (Single-Core Tuning)
innodb_read_io_threads = 2         # Reduced from 4
innodb_write_io_threads = 2        # Reduced from 4
innodb_flush_method = O_DIRECT
